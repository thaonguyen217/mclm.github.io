            <!-- Despite their ability to understand chemical knowledge and accurately generate sequential representations, large language models (LLMs) remain limited in their capacity to propose novel molecules with drug-like properties.
            In addition, the molecules that LLMs propose can often be challenging to make in the lab.
            To more effectively enable the discovery of functional small molecules, LLMs need to learn a molecular language.
            However, LLMs are currently limited by encoding molecules from atoms.
            In this paper, we argue that just like tokenizing texts into (sub-)word tokens instead of characters, molecules should be decomposed and reassembled at the level of functional building blocks, i.e., parts of molecules that bring unique functions and serve as effective building blocks for real-world automated laboratory synthesis.
            This motivates us to propose mCLM, a modular Chemical-Language Model tokenizing molecules into building blocks and learning a bilingual language model of both natural language descriptions of functions and molecule building blocks.
            By reasoning on such functional building blocks, mCLM guarantees to generate efficiently synthesizable molecules thanks to recent progress in blockbased chemistry, while also improving the functions of molecules in a principled manner.
            In experiments on 430 FDA-approved drugs, we find mCLM capable of significantly improving 5 out of 6 chemical functions critical to determining drug potentials.
            More importantly, mCLM can reason on multiple functions and improve the FDA-rejected drugs (“fallen angels”) over multiple iterations to greatly improve their shortcomings. -->
            <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown they can understand chemistry and generate molecule-like strings. But when it comes to suggesting new drug-like molecules, they often fall short. Many of the molecules they create are hard to make in the lab and don’t have the right properties to be useful as real medicines. To do better, we believe LLMs need to learn the language of molecules—not just from atoms, but from meaningful building blocks. Just like words are made up of subwords, molecules can be broken down into <b><i>functional building blocks</i></b>—pieces that carry out specific roles in chemistry and are easier to assemble in the lab.</p>
            <p>That’s why we created <b>mCLM</b>, a modular Chemical-Language Model. Instead of learning from atoms, mCLM learns from these building blocks and connects them with natural language descriptions of their functions. It’s like teaching the model a bilingual dictionary: one side is chemistry, the other is plain language. With this approach, mCLM can design molecules that are not only easier to synthesize but also more functional.</p>
            <p>When tested on <b><i>430 FDA-approved drugs</i></b>, it improved 5 out of 6 key chemical properties linked to drug effectiveness. Even more exciting, it can refine failed drug candidates (sometimes called “fallen angels”) by reasoning over their weaknesses and improving them step by step.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, mCLM opens the door to a new way of designing molecules, offering:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Synthesis efficiency:</b> Molecules are designed in a modular way that makes them easier and faster to synthesize. The process is simple, general, and machine-friendly—ideal for rapid drug discovery and automated lab experiments.</li>
              <li><b>Alignment with language models:</b> Just like natural language is broken into words, modularizing molecules provides a cleaner interface for language models to understand and generate chemical structures.</li>
              <li><b>Reasoning:</b> With its ability to follow instructions and leverage large-scale knowledge, mCLM can iteratively refine molecules based on their intended functions—bringing LLMs one step closer to intelligent molecular design.</li>

        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>In this work, we introduce a chemical vocabulary built from <b><i>synthesis-friendly building blocks</i></b>. This vocabulary is designed to support automated, step-by-step assembly of molecules—making the synthesis process faster and more reliable.</p>
          <p>These building blocks aren’t just random pieces; they are chemically meaningful units closely tied to important molecular functions. For example, certain blocks might help a molecule bind to a protein target, influence enzyme activity, or interact with metabolic pathways. By working at this functional level, our model can quickly propose new molecules, automate their synthesis, and generate useful functional data as needed.</p>
          <p>Unlike traditional SMILES strings—which turn molecules into linear sequences but sometimes break important chemical connections—our vocabulary reflects the real, physical layout of molecules. This means that the representation preserves how building blocks are actually connected in space, allowing for more natural and accurate molecule design. In short, this function-infused, synthesis-friendly vocabulary enables rapid, practical, and meaningful molecular discovery. The figure below illustrates how our tokenization method works.</p>

            <figcaption>An overview of the tokenization process. A functional molecule is first broken down by a synthesis-guaranteed tokenizer into building blocks designed for automated modular synthesis. These blocks are then checked to see if they fully represent the original molecule. If the coverage is complete, the blocks are used directly for pretraining. If not, the molecule is re-tokenized using a rule-based method to ensure full representation for training.</figcaption>

          <p>The figure below illustrates the architecture of mCLM, our multimodal Chemical-Language Model. This sequential generative model processes both molecular and natural language sequences in a unified framework. At its core, mCLM leverages the Transformer architecture, which excels at handling sequential data and allows us to build on powerful pre-trained language models as a backbone.</p>

            <figcaption>Overview of the mCLM, a multimodal chemical-language model that tokenizes molecules into building blocks. Trained on datasets containing molecular properties, functions, and synthesis information, mCLM performs critical chemical reasoning through an iterative process to progressively refine molecular designs.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>After tokenizing molecules using the method described earlier, each molecular building block is encoded through graph neural networks (GNNs). These molecular representations are then seamlessly integrated with natural language embeddings at positions corresponding to molecule entity names. This creates a <b><i>“code-switched”</i></b> language that effectively blends molecular structures with their textual descriptions.</p>
          <p>The combined feature sequence is fed into a Transformer decoder-only architecture, which predicts the next token based on all previously generated tokens. This setup enables pre-training on large, multimodal datasets, allowing the model to learn rich relationships between molecular structures and natural language. To maximize efficiency, mCLM is fine-tuned on top of open-source large language models pre-trained on general-domain text corpora. This approach leverages existing linguistic knowledge without the heavy computational burden of training from scratch.</p>
          <p>Our training objective employs a unified categorical cross-entropy loss that jointly optimizes for both natural language tokens and molecular building blocks. Formally, the loss compares the true token distribution with the model’s predicted distribution over a shared vocabulary of words and molecular fragments. For natural language tokens, embeddings are directly sourced from the pre-trained language model. For molecular building blocks, embeddings are generated by passing their graph representations through GNNs, followed by a linear adapter that projects them into the same embedding space. This joint training mechanism enables mCLM to fluently “speak” the combined language of chemistry and natural language, bridging the gap between molecular structure and textual description in a single, elegant model.</p>

          <p>Designing a good molecule isn’t just about getting one property right—it’s about balancing many, often conflicting, chemical functions. Real-world drug design requires optimizing factors like toxicity, bioactivity, and binding affinity all at once. And improving one function can often hurt another. For instance, a molecule with strong potency might also turn out to be highly toxic, making it unsuitable as a drug.</p>
          <p>Nature solves this through evolution, gradually refining molecules over billions of years. Inspired by this, we built a reasoning process into our model, mCLM, that allows it to refine its own molecule designs through multiple rounds of improvement.</p>
          <p>Here’s how it works: instead of trying to design the perfect molecule in one go, mCLM proposes a version of the molecule, evaluates its functional strengths and weaknesses, and then makes targeted edits to improve it. In each iteration, the model identifies which building blocks still have room for improvement and modifies them with a specific function in mind. This loop continues until either the model reaches a set number of steps or no further meaningful improvements can be made.</p>

        <div class="content has-text-justified">
            <p>To evaluate how well our model-generated molecules perform, we created oracle models—predictive tools that estimate key drug-like properties. Specifically, we focused on ADMET properties: Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity. These are critical to understanding how a molecule might behave in the body. We selected six widely used evaluation tasks from the Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) benchmark:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>AMES:</b> Mutagenicity (whether a molecule might cause genetic mutations)</li>
              <li><b>BBBP:</b> Blood-brain barrier permeability</li>
              <li><b>CYP3A4:</b> Inhibition of a key metabolic enzyme</li>
              <li><b>DILI:</b> Drug-induced liver injury</li>
              <li><b>HIA:</b> Human intestinal absorption</li>
              <li><b>PGP:</b> Interaction with a transporter protein involved in drug resistance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We built an ensemble of three models—FARM, ChemBERTA-2, and a GNN—to extract features from molecules and predict their drug-like properties. This gives us a robust way to evaluate how our generated molecules might perform.</p>
            <p><b>Improving FDA-Approved Drugs with Out-of-Vocabulary Blocks</b></p>
            <p>We tested mCLM on all 430 FDA-approved drugs made of at least 3 building blocks. Most of these molecules (426 out of 430) included blocks the model never saw during training—making this a tough out-of-distribution test. Despite this, mCLM improved 5 out of 6 key drug properties, as shown in the table below. This highlights the model’s ability to generalize and enhance real-world molecules, even with unfamiliar components.</p>

          <p><b>Multi-step Critical Reasoning to Resurrect the “Fallen Angels”</b></p>
          <p>Some drug candidates make it far in development but fail just before FDA approval—often due to a single critical issue. These "fallen angels" still hold great promise because their strengths are known, as are their weaknesses.</p>
          <p>Take <b>Evobrutinib</b>, which showed potential for treating multiple sclerosis but was halted due to liver toxicity. Or <b>TNG348</b>, designed to treat BRCA1/2-mutant cancers, but stopped in trials for similar reasons. These molecules represent high-impact opportunities for AI-driven optimization.</p>
          <p>Using <b>mCLM</b>, we can apply <b><i>multi-step functional reasoning</i></b> to repair these failed drugs. As shown in the figure below, the model first targets the known issue (e.g., liver toxicity), then sequentially improves other affected properties—like PGP for Evobrutinib or BBBP for TNG348. Each change is small, often modifying just <b><i>one building block at a time</i></b>, ensuring synthesizability remains intact.</p>
